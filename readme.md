Here lies the result of my code challenge. As with any of these things there is a wonder in what the evaluator is actually interested in and never any feedback folloowing to know if architecture is more important and if so what architecture do they like and is there any room for discussion as if there are actual pros and cons.

So here is my best shot at guessing what you find important and do it using a reasonable amount of my time, yes I was given a week, but what amount do I have to give, given the holidays, other code challenges and demands on personal time.

I concentrated on the function of the app and having to decode the requirements and making sure those were met. Then tried to organize the code in a readable manor. I made the assumption that the newest technologies would be desired so I ported a wizard created app to AndroidX and the current Material Design components and worked from there.



Things I would have liked to improve upon:

* Collating the films on one line insteead of a line item for each location and film.
* More design flourish, a real app has design input and while I have skill in that area, tight time constraints limit the output
